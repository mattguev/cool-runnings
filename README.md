# Runner’s Route Generator

The idea here was to build a program that runners could use to plan their speed work routes. The 3 most common types of speed work are:

1. Fartlek - unstructured runs in which periods of faster running are mixed with periods of easy-paced or moderate-paced running
2. Tempo - sustained effort run that builds up your body’s ability to run faster for longer periods of time
3. Interval - alternating short bursts of intense activity with longer periods of less intense activity or even rest.

These training methods aim to build a sense of familiarity with pace and mechanics. They require a level of 'flow' which can be hard to achieve without access to a track or treadmill, since the runner is otherwise preoccupied with navigating twisting, unfamiliar terrain. The objective was to eliminate these training barriers and improve beginner race performance by building a route generator which offerred three features:

- Runners could specify any land-based start point in the world
- Runners could hypothetically specify any distance, but would ideally choose 1 of the 4 most common World Athletics categories (5K, 10K, 21K, 42K)
- The route generator would generate the straightest possible route to avoid overwhelming runners' bandwidth with changing directions.
