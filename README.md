# Runner’s Route Generator

The idea here was to build a program that runners could use to plan their speed work routes. The 3 most common types of speed work are:

1. Fartlek - unstructured runs where periods of faster running are mixed with periods of easy-paced or moderate-paced running
2. Tempo - sustained effort run that builds up your body’s ability to run faster for longer periods of time
3. Interval - alternating short bursts of intense activity with longer periods of less intense activity or even rest.

These training methods improve performance by polishing runners' mechanics and sense of pace. All three require a level of 'flow' which is best achieved by access to a track or treadmill. Otherwise, runners can spend their entire workout preoccupied with the navigation of twisting, unfamiliar terrain. With these factors in mind, the objective was to build a route generator which would eliminate these training barriers and improve beginner race performance by offering three features:

- Runners could specify any land-based start point in the world
- Runners could hypothetically specify any distance, but would ideally choose 1 of the 4 most common World Athletics categories (5K, 10K, 21K, 42K)
- The route generator would generate the straightest possible route to avoid overwhelming runners' bandwidth with changing directions.
